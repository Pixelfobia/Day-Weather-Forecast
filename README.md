## Description
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
This webpage was created so that a user can find current conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city. The developer was tasked with using the Open Weather API to create the dashboard. Some of the development tasks included:

Presenting the user with current conditions (temperature, humidity and wind speed) and the 5-day forecast.

Displaying the search history on the page and making it dynamic so that the user can click on it to retrieve the weather information for that city.
